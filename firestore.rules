/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Corporate Magnate Cooperative Society Ltd.
 *
 * This ruleset implements role-based and ownership-based access control.
 * Admin roles are determined by a Firebase Auth custom claim (`request.auth.token.admin == true`).
 * Admins have broad read/write access to core collections.
 * Borrowers (users) can create their own profile and loan applications,
 * but can only read/update their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /Borrowers/{borrowerId}: Stores public profiles for borrowers.
 * - /Loans/{loanId}: Stores loan details, linked to a borrower.
 * - /ExcelFiles/{excelId}: Stores metadata about admin-uploaded Excel files.
